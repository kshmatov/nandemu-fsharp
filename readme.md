# Virtual machine for NAND to Tetris course

## Disclaimer:
    I just started to learn F# and dotnet.

## Done
- ram
- rom
- cpu
- screen
- keyboard (CapsLock sends Esc code)

## Usage
```
$ nandvm.exe [programm_file_path]
```

Programm is optional, expected any programm in "hack" format, see NAND to Tetris course. If no filename is given vm will run sample programm wich computes 2 + 3 and store result in D-register.

## Info
This is "just for fun" project, do not expect any cool stuff here. And I never write anything with C# or WinForms, so visual part may be more ugly then any other.

Fill free to get this code, blame it or print and burn it. 

**Good luck and be happy!**
