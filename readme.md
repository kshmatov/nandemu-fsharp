Virtual machine for NAND to Tetris course

Done: ram, rom, cpu, screen, keyboard

I just started to learn F# and dotnet.

Usage: nandvm.exe [programm_file_path]
Programm is optional, expected any programm in "hack" format, see NAND to Tetris course. If no filename is given vm will run sample programm wich computes 2 + 3 and store result in D-register.

This is fun project, do not expect any cool stuff here. And I never write anything with C# or WinForms, so this part may be more ugly then any other.

Fill free to get this code, blame it or print and burn it. Good luck and be happy!
